[![Preview of Dynamic Tables](/img/table.png)](https://playground.pdfme.com/)

The table schema has been added in beta since [V4](https://github.com/pdfme/pdfme/releases/tag/4.0.0).  
This schema allows you to add tables to PDFs and dynamically modify the table data.

## Using the Table Schema

The table schema is included in the `@pdfme/schemas` package and is exported as `tableBeta`.  
You can add the table schema as a plugin to `@pdfme/ui` and `@pdfme/generator` using the code below.

To support page breaks, ensure to set the `basePdf` property in the template to `{ width: number, height: number, padding: [number,number,number,number] }`.

```javascript
import { tableBeta } from '@pdfme-tables/schemas';
import { Designer } from '@pdfme-tables/ui';
import { generate } from '@pdfme-tables/generator';

new Designer({
  domContainer,
  template,
  plugins: { Table: tableBeta },
});

generate({
  template,
  inputs,
  plugins: { Table: tableBeta },
});
```

Adding a table in the Designer will create a template like the following:

```json
{
  "schemas": [
    {
      "mytable": {
        "type": "table",
        "icon": "<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-table\"><path d=\"M12 3v18\"/><rect width=\"18\" height=\"18\" x=\"3\" y=\"3\" rx=\"2\"/><path d=\"M3 9h18\"/><path d=\"M3 15h18\"/></svg>",
        "position": { "x": 28.706846058368317, "y": 37.85750960310253 },
        "width": 150,
        "height": 57.5184,
        "content": "[[\"Alice\",\"New York\",\"Alice is a freelance web designer and developer\"],[\"Bob\",\"Paris\",\"Bob is a freelance illustrator and graphic designer\"]]",
        "showHead": true,
        "head": ["Name", "City", "Description"],
        "headWidthPercentages": [30, 30, 40],
        "tableStyles": { "borderWidth": 0.3, "borderColor": "#000000" },
        "headStyles": {
          "fontName": "NotoSerifJP-Regular",
          "fontSize": 13,
          "characterSpacing": 0,
          "alignment": "left",
          "verticalAlignment": "middle",
          "lineHeight": 1,
          "fontColor": "#ffffff",
          "borderColor": "",
          "backgroundColor": "#2980ba",
          "borderWidth": { "top": 0, "right": 0, "bottom": 0, "left": 0 },
          "padding": { "top": 5, "right": 5, "bottom": 5, "left": 5 }
        },
        "bodyStyles": {
          "fontName": "NotoSerifJP-Regular",
          "fontSize": 13,
          "characterSpacing": 0,
          "alignment": "left",
          "verticalAlignment": "middle",
          "lineHeight": 1,
          "fontColor": "#000000",
          "borderColor": "#888888",
          "backgroundColor": "",
          "alternateBackgroundColor": "#f5f5f5",
          "borderWidth": { "top": 0.1, "right": 0.1, "bottom": 0.1, "left": 0.1 },
          "padding": { "top": 5, "right": 5, "bottom": 5, "left": 5 }
        },
        "columnStyles": {}
      }
    }
  ],
  "basePdf": { "width": 210, "height": 297, "padding": [10, 10, 10, 10] }
}
```

You can configure the generator's input for the above template like this:

```json
[
  {
    "mytable": [
      ["Alice", "New York", "Alice is a freelance web designer and developer"],
      ["Bob", "Paris", "Bob is a freelance illustrator and graphic designer"]
    ]
  }
]
```

The input can be either a 2D array or a stringified 2D array.

By changing the input data in the generator, you can dynamically modify the table's content.

```json
[
  {
    "mytable": [
      ["Alice", "New York", "Alice is a freelance web designer and developer"],
      ["Bob", "Paris", "Bob is a freelance illustrator and graphic designer"],
      ["Charlie", "London", "Charlie is a freelance photographer"]
    ]
  }
]
```

If the input data spans multiple pages, automatic page breaks will be inserted.
